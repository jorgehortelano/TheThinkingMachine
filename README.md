This software generated in Java allows the creation of a character sheet for the role play game called **Fading Suns** (Revised Edition). Personally, I do not like the provided character sheet in the Player's Guide book, and I have designed a new one, based on some old files I have found ten years ago for previous versions of this game.

To get an idea of the final result, here you have a preview:

If you like the design, and you want to use it, only the final PDF document is needed. To avoid the complexity of compilate this source code and using some programming languages, you can directly download the PDF from these links:
- [Character Sheet (English)](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/blob/master/sheets/FadingSuns_EN.pdf)
- [Character Sheet (Spanish)](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/blob/master/sheets/FadingSuns_ES.pdf)

The fonts needed for these PDFs are: [ArchitectsDaughter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter), [DejaVuSans](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) and [Roman Antique](http://www.steffmann.de/wordpress/). All of them can be use freely for non-commercial use. You need to download and install them.

If you want to skip the font installation, you can also donwload the sheet in PNG:

- [Character Sheet Reverse (English)](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/blob/master/sheets/FadingSuns_EN-1.png)
- [Character Sheet (Spanish)](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/blob/master/sheets/FadingSuns_ES-0.png)
- [Character Sheet Reverse (Spanish)](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/blob/master/sheets/FadingSuns_ES-1.png)

Click any of these links to get a complete updated copy of the sheet. Still, the code of this application is provided in Github for some reasons:
* Maybe somebody wants to change some texts of the character sheet.
* Maybe somebody wants to translate it to a different language (see below for some instructions).
* In general, I like the idea of free source, and I release this software under the GNU General Public License. 

## Adding a new language
If you are interested in the translation of the sheet in a different language, at the [Wiki](https://github.com/jorgehortelano/TheThinkingMachine/wiki/Adding-a-new-Language) of this project you can find some instructions. 

## Execution
The application has been created using Maven with Java. Therefore, for excuting this application you need both Maven and Java installed on your machine. Then you must execute this command inside the `thinking-machine-core` folder: 

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="en /path/to/file"
```
Where `en` is the language to obtain the file (now can be `en`, `es`) and `/path/to/file` must be a valid path where the application has permissions to generate a file. If this execution is too complex for you, you can always do a pull request on this project and I will generate it for you. 

You can also convert PDF to PNG automatically if you have ImageMagick installed and is at the path. Execute this Maven command:

```
mvn install -Prelease
```
And all the possible PDFs will be generated and later converted to PNG. Final result is located in the sheet folder. 

## Notes
This software has been developed using the [iText library](http://itextpdf.com/) for PDF generation. 

Fading Suns is a TradeMark owned by Holistic Design. 

Fonts used in this project: DejaVuSans, ArchitectsDaughter and Roman Antique. 

[ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is a free image manipulation software.
